# Alternative Email Setup Guide

If Gmail App Passwords are hard to find, you can use Outlook instead!

## Option 1: Outlook.com (Easier Setup)

1. **Use any Outlook.com email** (create new one if needed)
2. **No App Password needed** - just use your regular password
3. **Update your .env file**:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=youremail@outlook.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_regular_outlook_password
   ```

## Option 2: Create New Gmail Account

Sometimes new Gmail accounts have easier App Password access:

1. **Create a new Gmail** specifically for this app
2. **Enable 2FA immediately** during setup
3. **App passwords should be more visible** on new accounts

## Option 3: Yahoo Mail

Yahoo is also easier:
1. **Use Yahoo email**
2. **Generate App Password** (easier process than Gmail)
3. **Works the same way**
